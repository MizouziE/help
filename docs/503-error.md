## Common reasons and solutions

In most cases 503 server errors are not a server issue, but something with your code and configuration. There are many different reasons for 5xx errors. Good news is that they are mostly easy to debug for you.


### Check the logs

Become a detective. Start the investigation by examining the logs of your App - see [here for Uni Apps](logging-uni) and [here for Pro Apps](logging-pro). Within the logs you will find where application exited with which error: This is the hot lead you are after. Compare this with your local development environment and see if it fails the same way. Review your latest code changes.


## It could also be something on our side

It is also possible â€” although less likely - that this error is caused by a network, hardware or configuration issue on our side, your hosting provider. Please check our status page under [status.fortrabbit.com](https://status.fortrabit.com) if there are any ongoing maintenance windows or service issues known.
