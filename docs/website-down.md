Your website hosted on fortrabbit is not online any more. This is an urgent situation. Let's waste no time and get it solved together.

Understand that most website downtime is individual and caused by code and configuration issues. While you might have a support ticket opened already, please help us helping by answering the follow questions.


## What's the exact App name?

Make sure to provide the exact App name. Is the happening to just one App hosted here or to multiple or all?

## Make sure to have your developer on board

When you are the Owner of the App but not the technical contact we advice to get your developer in contact with us.


## Have you made any recent changes?

Did you maybe recently pushed code? Or did some editor changed some setting on the App? Or was there any other change done, prior the downtime?


## What kind of error do you see?

There are many reasons why websites might go down. Often the error you are seeing gives a good hint on what the issue might be.

It's likely a 504 error when the website is loading and loading but never shows up. Please proceed to our [504 troubleshooting](/504-errors) page.

It's likely a 503 error when you see a "service unavailable" message or just a blank screen. Please proceed to our [503 troubleshooting](/503-errors) page. Provide PHP error logs with your question.
