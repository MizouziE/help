## Choose your Stack

There are [two hosting stacks](/stacks) here on fortrabbit. You can choose with each new [App](/app) your create:

1. The [Universal Stack](/app-uni) has VPS or shared hosting feeling. It's easy to use, affordable, but limited in scaling. Use it for testing + small projects.
2. The [Professional Stack](/app-pro) is designed to scale horizontally. All components are redundant to assure high uptime. Use it for serious business + potentially large sites. 


## Workflow

1. **[Install Craft CMS locally](craft-install-local)**: Install new with Composer or use an existing project
2. **[Setup Craft for fortrabbit](/craft-setup)**: Prepare environment, set defaults
3. **[Deploy Craft](/craft-deploy-craft-copy)**: Use our Craft Copy tool
5. **[Tune Craft](/craft-tune)**: Master it!
