## How can I open a ticket?

To start a conversation, open the chat bubble on the bottom right corner. Signed-in users are automatically registered and can submit new tickets and view history on previously opened tickets.

## When will I get an answer?

We will answer as soon as possible. The median response time has been around 50 minutes, historically. The median time to close was around 4 hours. That means that, sometimes we chat, sometimes answers are delayed.

## What is median answer time?

Median is similar to average, see the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median). Sometimes we answer quickly, sometimes it can take a while. It's NOT the guaranteed answer time, it's the middle.

## Can you help me migration my websites over?

Sorry, as noted, fortrabbit is a self service for developers. You will always need a developer to handle fortrabbit. We do not offer hands-on migration services. We are always happy to help with specific technical questions on the matter. There is also a detailed [guide](https://help.fortrabbit.com/migrating) for that. Doing the migration on your own helps you understanding how deployment works here. 

## What if we will have a traffic spike event?

We might be able to prepare that with you. Please let us know a couple of days in advance.

## What if I have an urgent question?

That doesn't happen often. The scope of our support here is helping you deploying code and configuring your Apps. Mind that we are also monitoring our systems for general issues. So the few urgent cases we seeing are usually when clients accidentally mess up or delete things. We have priority criteria policies. Urgent and important cases will be answered first.

## What if I miss the answer?

That usually doesn't happen. You will get the answer by e-mail, when you are away. You can also answer on that e-mail or jump back into chat at any time. It works really well.

## Do you offer premium support?

Kind of. We have [Company plans](https://www.fortrabbit.com/company-plans) for enhanced collaboration features and better support. Clients with company plans enabled will get on the important list. We will take more time to answer tickets and will look deeper.

## What other support channels do you offer?

Sorry, no telephone support hotline here, but you can call our office and we will likely answer the phone. fortrabbit limits the general support to online communication. It allows us to keep the pricing down, while maintaining a feature-rich application. It also helps us gathering system details and other information for effective troubleshooting. A lot of support is pointing to help articles, that's better in a written form. Also, we need to escalate tickets often, like from 1st level support to 2nd level, the full transcript is very helpful here.

## Do you offer 24/7 support?

Sorry no. Please see above to understand why.

## Where can I send feedback?

We like to hear your ideas! Please also use the support bubble.

## Can you support me with that obscure software I am using?

Maybe not. Please see our [software support levels document](https://help.fortrabbit.com/software-support-levels) to find which software we can support.
