## Terms

### Can we have custom terms?

Sorry, we cannot agree to negotiate custom terms with clients. The fortrabbit hosting platform service scope is: a standardized self-service hosting software solution for professionals and SMEs. The business relation is designed to be "light-weight".

We don't have a legal team on staff. There is no in house expertise to verify in which areas your custom contracts might contradict our own standard rules. The fortrabbit platform is constantly evolving. New features will usually affect all clients. New methods already need to be checked against our standard security standards, privacy rules and all legal aspects. Imagine how complicated that would become with additional individual contracts / agreements.

### Do you have a Technical and Organizational Measures document?

Please also understand that fortrabbit is mostly a software company - a so called Platform as a Service. The actual hosting infrastructure is running on AWS. Amazon Web Services are a premium cloud hosting service with high standards in all areas. Standard Technical and Organizational Measures for general hosting services therefore mostly don't apply here. We, for example, don't have physical access to data centers and therefore can not grant access to third party. This complies with other PaaS vendors on the market, also "only" providing pointers to the infrastructures TOM.


### Can you fill a W-8BEN-E form?

Sorry no.

### Do you have a Certificate of Insurance?

Sorry no. A COI is not common in Europe. And yes, fortrabbit is a GmbH, best translated in limited liability company (LLC). Likely you worry about revenue losses, due to technical problems. We — like any other hosting company — can not agree to be liable for your losses on downtime, except for cases of gross negligence covered with the terms here. You surely can imagine how expensive such a risk insurance would be, multiplying costs. Also see our [Service Level Agreement](/uptime) on that matter.

#### Do you comply with the NIC Directive (EU) 2016/1148?

Nope. From our understanding the Directive on security of network and information systems does not apply to us. Please understand that fortrabbit is mostly a software service, there are no physical network systems involved here. See our service scope. Apart from that our company is a small business.

## Support

### How can I open a ticket?

To start a conversation, open the chat bubble on the bottom right corner. Signed-in users are automatically registered and can submit new tickets and view history on previously opened tickets.

### When will I get an answer?

We will answer as soon as possible. The median response time has been around 50 minutes, historically. The median time to close was around 4 hours. That means that, sometimes we chat, sometimes answers are delayed.

### What is median answer time?

Median is similar to average, see the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median). Sometimes we answer quickly, sometimes it can take a while. It's NOT the guaranteed answer time, it's the middle.

### Can you help me migration my websites over?

Sorry, as noted, fortrabbit is a self service for developers. You will always need a developer to handle fortrabbit. We do not offer hands-on migration services. We are always happy to help with specific technical questions on the matter. There is also a detailed [guide](https://help.fortrabbit.com/migrating) for that. Doing the migration on your own helps you understanding how deployment works here. 

### What if we will have a traffic spike event?

We might be able to prepare that with you. Please let us know a couple of days in advance.

### What if I have an urgent question?

That doesn't happen often. The scope of our support here is helping you deploying code and configuring your Apps. Mind that we are also monitoring our systems for general issues. So the few urgent cases we seeing are usually when clients accidentally mess up or delete things. We have priority criteria policies. Urgent and important cases will be answered first.

### What if I miss the answer?

That usually doesn't happen. You will get the answer by e-mail, when you are away. You can also answer on that e-mail or jump back into chat at any time. It works really well.

### Do you offer premium support?

Kind of. We have [Company plans](https://www.fortrabbit.com/company-plans) for enhanced collaboration features and better support. Clients with company plans enabled will get on the important list. We will take more time to answer tickets and will look deeper.

### What other support channels do you offer?

Sorry, no telephone support hotline here, but you can call our office and we will likely answer the phone. fortrabbit limits the general support to online communication. It allows us to keep the pricing down, while maintaining a feature-rich application. It also helps us gathering system details and other information for effective troubleshooting. A lot of support is pointing to help articles, that's better in a written form. Also, we need to escalate tickets often, like from 1st level support to 2nd level, the full transcript is very helpful here.

### Do you offer 24/7 support?

Sorry no. Please see above to understand why.

### Where can I send feedback?

We like to hear your ideas! Please also use the support bubble.

### Can you support me with that obscure software I am using?

Maybe not. Please see our [software support levels document](https://help.fortrabbit.com/software-support-levels) to find which software we can support.

## Pricing

### What's included in the price?

No configuration required. Apps are instant and come ready to use with a private Git repo, Composer integration, an App URL, ephemeral storage, traffic, collaboration features, App Secrets and more.

### Which plan is right for me?

Scaling depends on the type of your application (vertical scaling) and the traffic it serves (horizontal scaling). Start with a **Play** preset and go on from there. See our [scaling tips]({{ help_url }}/scaling) and please don't hesitate to [contact sales](mailto:sales@fortrabbit.com).

### Can I test it for free?

Yes! It is possible to test a medium preset without obligations. You can even ask us to extend your trial period. Upgrade to a paid version when you are convinced.

### What's an App anyways?

An App is a container for your website or application. It comes with multiple Components, and a lot useful standards. See our [all about Apps article]({{ help_url }}/app).

### How many websites in one App?

One App shall host one website. Each App comes with a dedicated App URL, dedicated metrics, a single Git repo and collaboration features. The tiny tinkering plans are designed for small websites.

### What's a Component?

A Component is an individually scaleable service (PHP, MySQL, Memcache …). Each App can have multiple Components at different scaling states. Presets are common combinations of Components.

### What's a Node?

A Node is a virtual machine that is optimized for a certain Component (PHP, MySQL …). Apps are running distributed across multiple Nodes. Node resources are shared: the higher the Components scaling plan, the less Apps are hosted on a single Node.

### What about data center locations?

You can currently choose between US1, Virginia (USA) and EU1, Dublin (Ireland) as location for your App.

### Can I cancel at any time?

Yes, you can quit your Account completely with immediate effect at any time directly from the Dashboard or scale down components or delete Apps.

### How do you bill?

You pay as you grow. At the end of each month, we'll bill for the monthly usage. The billing period is daily. So you'll be charged just for the days you have actually used a certain App or Component.

### What's the tinkering level?

Use for development, testing, playing, experiments, staging, feature branches, hot fixes, pet projects, weekend hacks, student work, personal blogs, low traffic websites … [99% Uptime guarantee](/sla "See our Service Level Agreement").

### What's the production level?

Use for professional work, commercial projects, mission critical Apps, live sites, high traffic campaigns … [99.9% Uptime guarantee](/sla "See our Service Level Agreement").

### What about taxes?

The fortrabbit service is professional B2B hosting, for entrepreneurs only. Prices are net and subject to statutory VAT and may be added. Please also see our [billing FAQ page]({{ help_url }}/billing#toc-taxes).

### What about support?

Most of our clients prefer self-service. The Dashboard is powerful and self-explaining. The additional [documentation]({{ help_url }}) is actually helpful. On top of that we offer [affordable professional support](/support).

### My question is not listed here!

You can search our [help pages]({{ help_url }}/) and of course we would like to hear it directly, please [mail us](mailto:sales@fortrabbit.com).
