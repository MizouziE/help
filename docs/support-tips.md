## Read and search first, then ask

Consider the following pattern when you have a question:

1. Read our documentation
2. Search the error logs, check Google and Stack Overflow
3. Haven't found answer? Ask us!

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too. And it helps you, to get up running faster on your own.

## Be specific

Ambiguity is the kryptonite of support. Give us timestamps, full error messages, error logs, screenshots, URLs, and any other specific information that can help to identify problems. Bad example: "Urgent. Something is wrong. Fix this ASAP!"

## Describe your problem in technical terms

Use tech language to describe your problem. Invest the time to make explain exactly what's going on. Bad example: "My site is stuck."

## Provide sufficient information right away

Hello? You there? Hello? Somebody there? Don't expect to always get a prompt answer, describe your question in detail upfront. Take the time to outline your problem. Reduce ping-pong, provide sufficient details.

## Open only one ticket per issue

Please don't try to speed up things by asking the same questions multiple times. Opening multiple tickets on the same issue will only impeded our ability to provide timely support.

## Discuss only one issue per ticket

If you have a different problem than the previous one, start a new conversation. Each conversation should have one topic, ideally.

## Include replication steps

We almost always need to recreate the problem. Please provide us with the exact steps to replicate the issue. If we can't see it, we can't debug it.

## Ask for clarification

We are humans. Sometimes we may not always get it right. Ask for explanations when our answer doesn't make sense to you. Don't be afraid to correct us, or to ask for more details if we don't seem to understand the issue.

## Ask in english

That's the universal language we all speak.
