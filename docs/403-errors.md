## 403 error behavior

* 403 errors will usually be shown on screen immediately
* 403 errors often occur during setup or after code or configuration changes
* 403 errors here are often rendered using a fortrabbit error page template


## Common reasons and solutions

**In most cases this is not a server issue, but a problem with your code and/or configuration.** Please check the following common issues first:


### Wrong root path 

With certain CMS and frameworks we pre-populate the root path. So depending in your choice when creating the App, something might not be configured correctly. Check the [root path](/app#toc-root-path) of your App.


### .htaccess problems

Sometimes 403 errors are caused by issues with `.htaccess`. Check your `.htaccess` file. Developers using SFTP often forget to upload that hidden file. See our [.htaccess help](/htaccess).


### File permissions

Sometimes 403 errors are caused by wrong file permissions. This can happen when you deploy with SFTP or SSH. Make sure that PHP has write permissions for the files `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `storage/*`, `vendor/*` and other files. Set the file permissions for those files to `744` with your SFTP client or by SSH.  Any `*.php` files should be executable.

<!-- Duplicate with Craft CMS: Upload SFTP, maybe remove the other one -->


### Missing http-auth credentials

If you have used HTTP auth to protect your website from unwanted visitors and someone is trying access that without entering the correct username and password, a 403 access denied error will occur.


### DNS issues

Sometimes it takes a while until DNS is propagated. This can be when your App is new, you have upgraded the scaling or you have just routed a domain. Wait a little and try again.


### Wrong address

You might have an error with URL. Check for typos in the address bar (URL) of your browser.


## It could also be something on our side

It is also possible â€” although less likely - that this error is caused by a network, hardware or configuration issue on our side, your hosting provider. Please check our status page under [status.fortrabbit.com](https://status.fortrabbit.com) if there are any ongoing maintenance windows or service issues known.


## Contacting support

Whether your investigation (see above) leads to possible service issues on our side, or you are stuck debugging the issue on your own, don't hesitate to contact us.
