## What's included in the price?

No configuration required. Apps are instant and come ready to use with a private Git repo, Composer integration, an App URL, ephemeral storage, traffic, collaboration features, App Secrets and more.

## Which plan is right for me?

Scaling depends on the type of your application (vertical scaling) and the traffic it serves (horizontal scaling). Start with a **Play** preset and go on from there. See our [scaling tips](/scaling) and please don't hesitate to [contact sales](mailto:sales@fortrabbit.com).

## Can I test it for free?

Yes! It is possible to test a medium preset without obligations. You can even ask us to extend your trial period. Upgrade to a paid version when you are convinced.

## What's an App anyways?

An App is a container for your website or application. It comes with multiple Components, and a lot useful standards. See our [all about Apps article](/app).

## How many websites in one App?

One App shall host one website. Each App comes with a dedicated App URL, dedicated metrics, a single Git repo and collaboration features. The tiny tinkering plans are designed for small websites.

## What's a Component?

A Component is an individually scalable service (PHP, MySQL, Memcache …). Each App can have multiple Components at different scaling states. Presets are common combinations of Components.

## What's a Node?

A Node is a virtual machine that is optimized for a certain Component (PHP, MySQL …). Apps are running distributed across multiple Nodes. Node resources are shared: the higher the Components scaling plan, the less Apps are hosted on a single Node.

## What about data center locations?

You can currently choose between US1, Virginia (USA) and EU1, Dublin (Ireland) as location for your App.

## Can I cancel at any time?

Yes, you can quit your Account completely with immediate effect at any time directly from the Dashboard or scale down components or delete Apps.

## How do you bill?

You pay as you grow. At the end of each month, we'll bill for the monthly usage. The billing period is daily. So you'll be charged just for the days you have actually used a certain App or Component.

## What's the tinkering level?

Use for development, testing, playing, experiments, staging, feature branches, hot fixes, pet projects, weekend hacks, student work, personal blogs, low traffic websites … [99% Uptime guarantee](https://www.fortrabbit.com/sla)).

## What's the production level?
