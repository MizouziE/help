## Can we have custom terms?

Sorry, we cannot agree to negotiate custom terms with clients. The fortrabbit hosting platform service scope is: a standardized self-service hosting software solution for professionals and SMEs. The business relation is designed to be "light-weight".

We don't have a legal team on staff. There is no in house expertise to verify in which areas your custom contracts might contradict our own standard rules. The fortrabbit platform is constantly evolving. New features will usually affect all clients. New methods already need to be checked against our standard security standards, privacy rules and all legal aspects. Imagine how complicated that would become with additional individual contracts / agreements.

## Do you have a Technical and Organizational Measures document?

Please also understand that fortrabbit is mostly a software company - a so called Platform as a Service. The actual hosting infrastructure is running on AWS. Amazon Web Services are a premium cloud hosting service with high standards in all areas. Standard Technical and Organizational Measures for general hosting services therefore mostly don't apply here. We, for example, don't have physical access to data centers and therefore can not grant access to third party. This complies with other PaaS vendors on the market, also "only" providing pointers to the infrastructures TOM.

## Can you fill a W-8BEN-E form?

Sorry no.

## Do you have a Certificate of Insurance?

Sorry no. A COI is not common in Europe. And yes, fortrabbit is a GmbH, best translated in limited liability company (LLC). Likely you worry about revenue losses, due to technical problems. We — like any other hosting company — can not agree to be liable for your losses on downtime, except for cases of gross negligence covered with the terms here. You surely can imagine how expensive such a risk insurance would be, multiplying costs. Also see our [Service Level Agreement](/uptime) on that matter.

## Do you comply with the NIC Directive (EU) 2016/1148?

Nope. From our understanding the Directive on security of network and information systems does not apply to us. Please understand that fortrabbit is mostly a software service, there are no physical network systems involved here. See our service scope. Apart from that our company is a small business.
